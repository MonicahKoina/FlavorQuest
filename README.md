# FlavourSafari
FlavourSafari is a recipe finder websiteüë©‚Äçüç≥

sometimes it‚Äôs a real hassle trying to find the perfect recipe online. With our FlavourSafari websiter, we are going to make that search a piece of cake! Users can say goodbye to endless scrolling and confusing websites. Our webapp will be like a treasure chest, making it super easy to discover delicious dishes based on what they‚Äôre craving or the ingredients they have on hand. The website will operate by fetching recipe data from a food API, displaying it in a user-friendly interface and providing a seamless experience for discovering and organizing recipes.

Languages 

‚Ä¢ HTML and CSS for structuring the content of the app and making it virtually appealing by styling it.

‚Ä¢JavaScript- add  front-end interactivity, dynamic functionality and will be used for back-end server logic.

Platforms 
‚Ä¢ GitHub: For managing and collaboration. 

Books/Resources 
‚Ä¢ Mozilla Developer Network: For HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documentation.

Technology Choice Analysis 

-Fetch API over Axios because it is Native to modern browsers and there is no need for additional libraries.
 
CHALLENGE 

Our portfolio project is Intended to  address the challenge of meal planning and recipe 
discovery based on available ingredients. Often, individuals struggle with deciding what 
to cook with the ingredients they have at home. This can lead to wasted food, repeated meals, or unhealthy eating habits. The app provides a simple solution by allowing users to input available ingredients and receive a list of recipes that they can make. 

What the Portfolio Project Will Not Solve
1. Personalized Dietary Preference:While the app can suggest recipes based on ingredients, it may not fully account for specific dietary preferences.
2. Cooking Skills: The webapp assumes users have basic cooking knowledge and skills. It will 
not provide in-depth cooking tutorials or guidance for complete beginners. 
 
Language Support: Initially, the webapp may be available only in English. Expanding 
language support can make it more accessible to non-English speaking users around the world. 
By addressing these considerations, our recipe finder app aims to provide a valuable 
tool for a wide range of users globally, helping them to discover new recipes, reduce food waste, and simplify meal planning. 
 
RISKS
Technical Risks 
1. API Reliability and Changes

‚Ä¢ Potential Impact: The app relies on a third-party food API for fetching recipe data. If 
the API experiences downtime, changes in endpoints, or rate limits, it could disrupt the 
app‚Äôs functionality. 
- Safeguards: 
‚Ä¢	Implement error handling to manage API failures and provide users with appropriate messages.
‚Ä¢	Use caching strategies to store frequently accessed data. 
‚Ä¢	Monitor API usage and set up alerts for any anomalies. 
2. Data Privacy and Security 
‚Ä¢ Potential Impact: Handling user data, such as ingredient inputs or saved recipes, poses privacy and security risks. Data breaches or leaks could damage user trust and result in legal consequences. 
- Safeguards: 
‚Ä¢	Ensure secure communication using HTTPS. 
‚Ä¢	Implement proper data encryption for any stored user data. 
‚Ä¢	Follow best practices for authentication and authorization. 
‚Ä¢	Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities. 
3. Cross-Browser Compatibility	 
-Potential Impact: The app may not function correctly on all browsers, leading to a poor user experience for some users. 
- Safeguards: 
‚Ä¢	Test the application on multiple browsers and devices to ensure compatibility. Use modern, widely supported web technologies and polyfills where necessary. 
Non-Technical Risks 
1. User Adoption and Engagement	 
‚Ä¢ Potential Impact: If the app does not attract enough users or fails to engage them, it 
could lead to low usage and eventual abandonment. 
-Strategies: 
‚Ä¢	Conduct market research to understand user needs and preferences.
‚Ä¢	Implement user feedback mechanisms to continuously improve the app. 
‚Ä¢	Use marketing strategies such as social media promotion, SEO, and partnerships to increase visibility. 
2. Legal and Compliance Issues 
‚Ä¢Potential Impact: Non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) could result in legal penalties and damage to reputation. 
-Strategies: 
‚Ä¢	Ensure compliance with relevant data protection laws by implementing necessary policies and practices. 
‚Ä¢	Regularly review and update the app‚Äôs privacy policy. 
‚Ä¢	Seek legal advice to stay informed about regulatory changes. 
3. User Trust and Satisfaction 
‚Ä¢Potential Impact: Negative user experiences or data privacy concerns could erode trust and satisfaction, leading to negative reviews and loss of users. 
-Strategies: 
‚Ä¢	Prioritize user-centric design and development. 
‚Ä¢	Provide transparent communication about data usage and privacy. Implement robust customer support to address user issues promptly. 
By addressing these technical and non-technical risks with appropriate safeguards and 
strategies, the Recipe Finder app aims to provide a reliable, secure, and user-friendly 
experience, fostering growth and user satisfaction. 

INFRASTRUCTURE.
Branching and Merging Strategy
GitHub Flow
To maintain a structured and efficient workflow, we will use the GitHub Flow branching strategy. Here‚Äôs a detailed process for branching and merging:
1. Main Branch: The main branch will be the production-ready branch, containing the
latest stable code.
2. Feature Branches: For each new feature or bug fix, create a new branch from main.
Name the branch descriptively, such as feature/add-search-functionality or fix/button-style       	.
3. Developing Features  :
                            	
‚Ä¢Work on the feature or fix in your feature branch.
‚Ä¢Regularly commit your changes with clear and concise messages.
4. Pull Requests:
‚Ä¢Once the feature is complete and tested locally, open a pull request (PR) to merge the feature branch into main.
‚Ä¢Ensure that the PR description is detailed, including what the feature/fix entails and any relevant screenshots or notes.
5.Code Review:
‚Ä¢Team members review the PR for code quality, functionality, and potential issues.
‚Ä¢Address any feedback and make necessary changes.
6. Merging:
‚Ä¢Once approved, the PR is merged into main.
‚Ä¢Optionally, use ‚ÄúSquash and Merge‚Äù to keep a clean commit history.
This strategy ensures that main always contains stable and deployable code, while
feature branches allow for isolated development and thorough review before merging.
Data Population Strategy
Using the Spoonacular API       	
1. Fetching Data :
‚Ä¢Use Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the Spoonacular API to fetch recipes based on user inputs.
‚Ä¢Implement a server-side route (/Api/recipes) that handles these requests and sends the data to the frontend.
2. Caching:
‚Ä¢Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data and reduce API call frequency.
‚Ä¢Use an in-memory cache like Redis if necessary for performance improvement.
3. Seed Data for Development:
‚Ä¢Create a set of sample data for local development and testing to simulate API responses.
‚Ä¢This ensures that development can proceed without hitting the API rate limits.
Testing Tools and Automation
1. Unit Testing:
                            	
‚Ä¢ Use Jest for unit testing JavaScript code
‚Ä¢ Write tests for critical functions, API calls, and data handling processes.
2. Integration Testing:
* Use a tool like Supertest alongside Jest to test API endpoints and ensure that different parts of the application work together as expected..
4. Continuous Integration (CI) 	:
‚Ä¢Set up GitHub Actions to run automated tests on each push and pull request.
‚Ä¢Configure CI to run the test suite, ensuring that only code that passes all tests is merged into main.
5. Linting and Code Quality:
‚Ä¢Use ESLint to enforce coding standards and catch potential issues early.
‚Ä¢Integrate Prettier for consistent code formatting.
‚Ä¢Set up pre-commit hooks using Husky to run linting and formatting checks before code
is committed.
